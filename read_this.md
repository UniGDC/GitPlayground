# How do I add files to a new branch after having created the branch?

Basically, you have to select which branch you want to commit files. Since *master* branch is selected by default, in order to select a branch, you have to run a `git checkout <whatever-your-branch-name-is>` for Git shell, or you have to select which branch you want to commit files from upper left corner if you are using GitHub for Desktop.

Once you selected a branch, you can stage file and commit whatever you've created!

Well, first, sorry about that. I forgot to change the member permission.

Now you all have **admin** permission, you can make, delete, add teams or colaborators to a repository. Use it carefully, because **admin** power is strong enough to mess up a repository...!
